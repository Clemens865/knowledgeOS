# Testing Knowledge Graph Feature

## Summary
We've successfully implemented the **Knowledge Graph** feature for KnowledgeOS! ðŸŽ‰

## What It Does
The Knowledge Graph provides an interactive visualization of:
- All your notes as nodes
- Connections between notes (links)
- Tags as separate nodes
- Folders as organizational nodes

## How to Use
1. Open the sidebar (toggle button)
2. Go to **Tools** tab
3. Click **Knowledge Graph** (now marked as "New!")
4. Explore your knowledge visually:
   - **Drag** nodes to rearrange
   - **Click** nodes to open files
   - **Search** for specific nodes
   - **Filter** by type (notes, tags, folders)
   - **Zoom** in/out with scroll

## Features Implemented
- [[D3.js]] force-directed graph visualization
- Real-time node parsing from markdown files
- Link detection (wiki-style and markdown links)
- Tag extraction (#knowledgegraph #visualization #feature)
- Interactive controls (search, filter, refresh)
- Statistics panel showing connections

## Related Notes
- [[Analytics]] - Another tool in the Tools panel
- [[Conversation Modes]] - Custom AI behavior modes
- [[MCP Integration]] - External tool connections

## Technical Details
Built with:
- D3.js for graph rendering
- TypeScript for type safety
- IPC handlers for main process communication
- Glass morphism UI design

## Next Steps
- [[Smart Search]] - Coming next
- [[Link Explorer]] - Planned feature
- More graph layouts (tree, radial, etc.)
