# 🌳 Branch Status & Development Plan

## ✅ Current Setup

### Branch Structure
```
main (stable) ──────────────────────────┐
     ↓                                   │
     └─→ feature/knowledge-tools ← YOU ARE HERE 🎯
```

### What We've Done
1. ✅ **Committed conversation modes feature to main**
   - Full CRUD operations for custom modes
   - Default rules option
   - Import/export functionality
   - Menu integration (Cmd+Shift+C)

2. ✅ **Created feature branch**
   - Branch: `feature/knowledge-tools`
   - Pushed to GitHub
   - Ready for development

3. ✅ **Documentation created**
   - Git branching strategy guide
   - Feature roadmap
   - Implementation plans

## 🚀 Safe Development Workflow

### Why Use Feature Branches?
- **Main stays stable** - Users can always use the working app
- **Experiment freely** - Break things without affecting production
- **Easy rollback** - Just switch back to main if needed
- **Code review** - Create PR before merging
- **Parallel development** - Multiple features can be developed simultaneously

### Your Workflow Going Forward

```bash
# You're currently on feature/knowledge-tools
# All new development happens here

# Regular workflow:
1. Make changes
2. Test locally
3. Commit frequently
4. Push to feature branch
5. When ready, create PR to main
```

## 🎯 Next Steps for Knowledge Tools

### Priority 1: Knowledge Graph
We'll implement on `feature/knowledge-tools`:
- Graph data builder
- D3.js visualization
- Interactive UI
- Test thoroughly

### When Feature is Ready
```bash
# Create Pull Request
gh pr create --title "feat: add knowledge graph visualization" \
  --body "Implements interactive knowledge graph with D3.js"

# After review and approval
# Merge to main (via GitHub PR)

# Switch back to main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Delete feature branch
git branch -d feature/knowledge-tools
```

## 📋 Quick Commands Reference

### Switch Between Branches
```bash
# Go to main (stable app)
git checkout main

# Go back to feature branch
git checkout feature/knowledge-tools

# See all branches
git branch -a
```

### Save Work in Progress
```bash
# If you need to switch branches with uncommitted changes
git stash
git checkout main
# ... do something ...
git checkout feature/knowledge-tools
git stash pop
```

### Update Feature Branch from Main
```bash
# If main gets updates you need
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout feature/knowledge-tools
git merge main
```

## 🔒 Safety Features

### What's Protected
- **Main branch** is stable and working
- **All experiments** happen in feature branch
- **Easy recovery** - just checkout main if something breaks
- **GitHub backup** - everything is pushed

### If Something Goes Wrong
```bash
# Discard all local changes
git reset --hard

# Go back to stable main
git checkout main

# Start fresh feature branch
git branch -D feature/knowledge-tools
git checkout -b feature/knowledge-tools
```

## 📊 Current Development Status

| Feature | Branch | Status | Safety |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| Conversation Modes | main | ✅ Complete | Stable |
| Knowledge Graph | feature/knowledge-tools | 🚧 Starting | Isolated |
| Smart Search | feature/knowledge-tools | 📋 Planned | Isolated |
| Link Explorer | feature/knowledge-tools | 📋 Planned | Isolated |

## 🎉 Benefits of This Approach

1. **Zero risk to working app** - Main branch untouched
2. **Freedom to experiment** - Break things, try ideas
3. **Clean history** - Squash commits before merge
4. **Collaboration ready** - Others can review via PR
5. **Professional workflow** - Industry best practices

---

**You're all set!** 🚀 

The app is still running from main branch code, and all new development will happen safely in `feature/knowledge-tools`. When we're ready and tested, we'll merge back to main through a proper PR.
