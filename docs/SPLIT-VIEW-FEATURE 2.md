# Split View Feature - Implementation Complete ‚úÖ

## Overview
Successfully implemented a split view system that allows the Knowledge Graph, Analytics, and File Editor to be displayed alongside the conversation, giving these tools more screen space while keeping the chat always visible.

## What Was Built

### 1. Split Pane Layout
- **Resizable Split Panes**: Users can drag to resize the panels
- **Vertical/Horizontal Layouts**: Switch between side-by-side and top-bottom layouts
- **Persistent Conversation**: Chat remains visible while exploring tools

### 2. Toggle Button System
Located at bottom-right of the screen:
- üìù **Editor Toggle**: Open/close file editor in split view
- üß† **Knowledge Graph Toggle**: Open/close knowledge graph in split view
- üìä **Analytics Toggle**: Open/close analytics in split view
- ‚¨å/‚¨ç **Layout Toggle**: Switch between vertical/horizontal split

### 3. Enhanced User Experience
- **More Space**: Tools now use 50% of screen instead of narrow sidebar
- **Better Visualization**: Knowledge Graph nodes and connections are easier to see
- **Improved Workflow**: Can chat while viewing graphs, analytics, or editing files
- **Smooth Transitions**: Animated panel switching with fade effects

## Technical Implementation
