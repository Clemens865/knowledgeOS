# KnowledgeOS Project

## Summary
Building a revolutionary knowledge management system where the repository itself becomes the AI assistant through structured markdown files and intelligent rules.

## Vision
"What if instead of building a personal AI assistant, your repository WAS the AI assistant?"

## Core Concept
- The repository IS the assistant
- Markdown files store all knowledge
- AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Windsurf, Cursor) serve as interfaces
- Rules define behavior and organization
- Every interaction enriches the knowledge base

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Implementation of repository-as-assistant concept
- **Progress**: Initial structure and rules created
- **Next Steps**: Build knowledge base through active use

## Architecture
### Repository Structure
- `/knowledge-base/` - Main knowledge repository
- Organized folders for different knowledge types
- Markdown files with YAML frontmatter
- Cross-references using wiki-links

### Technology Stack
- **Interface**: VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code
- **Storage**: Markdown files in git repository
- **Future UI**: Electron + React + Monaco Editor
- **Graph Database**: Neo4j for relationships
- **Search**: Full-text and semantic search

## Development Approach
### Phase 1: Repository as Assistant (Current)
- Create comprehensive folder structure ✅
- Define behavioral rules ✅
- Start building knowledge base through use
- Develop utility scripts for processing

### Phase 2: Enhanced Interface
- Build dedicated Electron application
- Implement glass morphism UI
- Add knowledge graph visualization
- Integrate multiple AI providers

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Plugin system for extensibility
- Real-time collaboration
- Enterprise features
- Mobile and web platforms

## Key Insights
1. **Simplicity**: Start with what works - existing AI coding assistants
2. **Immediate Value**: Usable from day one, grows with use
3. **Persistence**: Repository provides natural memory
4. **Flexibility**: Works with any markdown-compatible tool
5. **Evolution**: Can add advanced features incrementally
