# KnowledgeOS Development Plan
## Multi-Phase Implementation Strategy

### Executive Summary
KnowledgeOS is an ambitious project to create a universal knowledge operating system that combines:
- **VS Code's editing power** (Monaco editor as core)
- **Obsidian-style knowledge management** (wiki-links, graph view)
- **AI-native intelligence** (multiple LLM providers, local-first)
- **Scalability** (personal assistant → enterprise knowledge base)

### Core Architecture Decisions

#### 1. VS Code as Backend Engine
- **Monaco Editor**: Full IDE capabilities in the browser/Electron
- **Language Server Protocol**: Support for 100+ programming languages
- **Extension System**: Leverage VS Code's proven plugin architecture
- **File System Provider**: Abstract file operations for flexibility
- **Debugging Protocol**: Built-in debugging capabilities

#### 2. Technology Stack
```yaml
Frontend:
  - Electron 25+ (Desktop application)
  - Monaco Editor (Code editing engine)
  - React 18 (UI framework)
  - Glass Morphism UI (from mockup)
  - Tailwind CSS (Styling)

Backend:
  - Node.js 20 LTS (Runtime)
  - SQLite (Local database)
  - Neo4j Embedded (Knowledge graph)
  - MiniSearch (Full-text search)
  - Vector DB (Semantic search)

AI Layer:
  - LangChain.js (AI orchestration)
  - Multiple providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama)
  - Local LLM support (Privacy-first)
  - MCP integration (Tool calling)
```

#### 3. Key Architectural Patterns
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: IPC communication between renderer and main
- **Plugin Architecture**: Sandboxed execution with defined APIs
- **CRDT-based Sync**: Conflict-free replicated data types for collaboration
- **Graph-First Storage**: Neo4j for relationships, SQLite for metadata

### Conclusion

KnowledgeOS represents a paradigm shift in knowledge management by combining the best of modern development tools with AI intelligence. By leveraging VS Code's proven architecture as our foundation, we can focus on building innovative knowledge features rather than reinventing the wheel.

The phased approach ensures we deliver value incrementally while building toward the ultimate vision of a universal knowledge operating system. With proper execution, KnowledgeOS can become the default choice for anyone working with information - from individual note-takers to enterprise knowledge bases.

**Key Success Factors**:
1. **VS Code Integration**: Leverage the full power of Monaco and LSP
2. **AI-Native Design**: Intelligence built-in, not bolted-on
3. **Local-First Philosophy**: Privacy and performance by default
4. **Extensible Architecture**: Infinite possibilities through plugins
5. **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple for beginners, powerful for experts
